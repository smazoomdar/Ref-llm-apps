# ollama is the Python client for Ollama, langchain-ollama provides LangChain integrations.
# Depending on how Ollama LLM is used by CrewAI (direct client vs LangChain integration), one or both might be needed.
# CrewAI's Ollama llm likely uses the `ollama` package.
# `langchain-ollama` is good for `OllamaEmbeddings` and `OllamaLLM` if used directly with LangChain.
# For safety, including both if distinct. If `langchain-ollama` includes `ollama`, then just `langchain-ollama`.
# Based on current usage (OllamaEmbeddings, and CrewAI's Ollama wrapper), both seem relevant.
# crewai[ollama] might pull in the right things too. For now, explicit.
