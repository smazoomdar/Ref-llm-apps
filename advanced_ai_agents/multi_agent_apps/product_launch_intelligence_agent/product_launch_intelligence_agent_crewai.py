## Detailed Analysis
Present the detailed analysis based on the generated insight bullets. Expand on each point with explanations, examples, and potential implications. Use subheadings for clarity.

## Strategic Recommendations
Offer actionable recommendations based on the analysis. These should be specific and targeted.

## Conclusion
Summarize the main takeaways and overall outlook.

Use markdown for formatting, including headers, subheaders, bullet points, and bold text for emphasis.
Ensure the report is professional, well-organized, and easy to read.
